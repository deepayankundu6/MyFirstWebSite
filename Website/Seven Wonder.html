	<P> <IMG SRC="TajMahal.jpg" ALT="[Taj Mahal]" ALIGN="Right"> 
	The Taj Mahal, in Agra, India, is the spectacular mausoleum built by Muslim Mughal Emperor Shahjahan to honor the memory of his beloved late wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Construction began in 1632 and took about 15 years to complete. </P>
	<P>Shahjahan was deposed and put under house arrest by one of his sons soon after the Taj Mahal's completion. It's said that he spent the rest of his days gazing at the Taj Mahal from a window. </P>

	<P> <IMG SRC="WallofChina.jpg" ALT="[Great Wall of China]" ALIGN="Right"> 
	This newly elected world wonder was built along China's northern border over many centuries to keep out invading Mongol tribes. Constructed between the fifth century B.C. and the 16th century, the Great Wall is the world's longest human-made structure, stretching some 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometres). The best known section was built around 200 B.C. by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang Di. 
	<P>The wall was among the winners of the New7Wonders poll announced during a televised ceremony in Lisbon, Portugal. However the Chinese state broadcaster chose not to broadcast the event, and Chinese state heritage officials refused to endorse the competition. It was a different story for some of the other candidates. In Brazil, for example, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva encouraged his compatriots to vote for Rio de Janeiro's mountaintop statue of Jesus Christ. </P>

	<P> <IMG SRC="PetraJordan.jpg" ALT="[Petra, Jordan]" ALIGN="Right"> 
	Perched on the edge of the Arabian Desert, Petra was the capital of the Nabataean kingdom of King Aretas IV (9 B.C. to A.D. 40). 
	Petra is famous for its many stone structures such as a 138-foot-tall (42-metre-tall) temple carved with classical facades into rose-colored rock. The ancient city also included tunnels, water chambers, and an amphitheater, which held 4,000 people. </P>
	<P>The desert site wasn't known to the West until Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt came across it in 1812. </P>
<P>Jordan has taken the New7Wonders competition seriously. Petra is an important attraction in a country where tourism has recently suffered due to troubles in the Middle East region, particularly in neighboring Iraq. 
The Jordanian royal family backed a campaign promoting Petra's selection. </P>

	<P>The ruined city is among the best known remnants of the Inca civilization, which flourished in the Andes region of western South America. The city is thought to have been abandoned following an outbreak of deadly smallpox, a disease introduced in the 1500s by invading Spanish forces. 
	Hundreds of people gathered at the remote, 7,970-foot-high (2,430-metre-high) site on Saturday to celebrate Machu Picchu's new "seven wonders" status. </P>

	<P>European sites that didn't make the cut include Stonehenge in the United Kingdom, the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, and the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. </P>
	<P>The Vatican in Rome accused the competition's organizers of ignoring Christian monuments, none of which was featured among the 20 finalists. Archbishop Mauro Piacenza, head of culture and archaeology at the Vatican, called the omission of sites such as the Sistine Chapel "inexplicable." </P>
